    <h1>One script via RequireJS optimizer</h1>

    <p><strong>Be sure to start up the server: node httpBuild.js</strong></p>

    <p>Demonstrates how to use the RequireJS optimizer to only load
    one script in the page using Node as the server to serve the optimized
    script. Using the "excludeShallow" build config option inside httpBuild.js
    allows debugging one script separate from the rest of the optimized file.</p>

    <p>See httpBuild.js in the same directory as this file for more information.</p>

    <hr>

    <!-- Successful load will print something after the hr tag -->

    <!-- httpBuild.js will return optimized content no matter what the URL
         is below. For deployment, replace this script tag to one that
         loads main-built.js, or whatever the config.out name value is
         inside httpBuild.js -->
